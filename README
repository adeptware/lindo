= lindo

Enables rendering of the body of an HTTP response from inside controller and
integration tests. This makes it easy to diagnose problems when building
assert_select statements or just sanity check the output of the test.

== Installation
  
Install the gem directly:

  sudo gem install adeptware-lindo --source=http://gems.github.com

Or install the gem in your Rails project:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/adeptware/lindo.git

Then require lindo in your test_helper.rb or spec_helper.rb file:

  require 'lindo'

You may also have to extend the Lindo module from your test or spec
helper if you use sessions in your integration tests:

  session.extend Lindo

== Usage

Insert the vr method in your functional test immediately after an HTTP
request has been sent:

  def test_new
    post :new
    vr
    assert_select "div[id=header]"
  end

vr attempts to open the response body in the default web browser. If you want
to open the raw HTML in the default text editor instead, simply pass the :html
symbol to the method:

  def test_new
    post :new
    vr(:html)
    ...
  end

By default, vr looks for an instance variable named @response and calls the #body
method on it. If your page body is stored in a different variable, such as when
testing a mailer, you can pass the raw HTML directly to vr and it will do the
right thing:

  def test_mailer
    mail = Mailer.create_notification
    vr(mail.body)
    ...
  end

Note that to use the default web view, your Rails application must be running
locally on port 3000. This will ensure that the page renders correctly with the
appropriate images and stylesheets. The server doesn't need to be running if
you use the HTML-only view.

== Compatibility

lindo requires OS X. Support for Windows is planned.

test/spec and test/unit work fine with lindo. RSpec, however, tests views
independently of controllers, so lindo won't work with it.

== Running Unit Tests

Use the rake command to run the unit tests for the plugin. The tests require
that the Mocha gem be installed locally:

  sudo gem install mocha
